# Web scrapper to get mail addresses of italian municipalities
Run the <strong>web_scrapper.py</strong> script, it'll store the mail directions into an archive called 'mail.txt' (feel free to change the name).
After that configure the mail_sender.py with your credentials, and also provide a valid email content, after that run the script and it'll start sending emails to the directions provided.
## Installation
I recommend to use pipenv to create a virtualenv and then install all the dependencies with:
```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
## Technologies:
```python
    #Requests
    #Urllib
    #Bs4
```
